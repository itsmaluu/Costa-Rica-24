# Costa Rica Wildlife Website 🦜🌿

This project is a personal website I built to showcase the animals and biodiversity I encountered during a study abroad trip to Costa Rica. It combines photos, field notes, and species information I collected in the Osa Peninsula.

## 🌟 Features
- Responsive layout with HTML and CSS
- Interactive navigation with buttons and image sections
- JavaScript-powered elements for dynamic page interactions
- A soft pink color palette and custom styling
- Pages include animal types, photos, and descriptions
- All content based on real data I gathered in the field

## 📚 Background
I originally created this website during my **first year of college** as a way to document my experience. Since then, I've returned to the project multiple times to **tweak and improve the code** whenever I learned something new — whether it was cleaner HTML structure, better CSS styling, or adding interactivity with JavaScript.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## 💡 Purpose
This project allowed me to apply front-end web development skills to a real personal experience, blending tech and storytelling. It’s also a reflection of my growing interest in design, user experience, and nature-based digital content.
